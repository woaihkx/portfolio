            <h3>A proud teacher</h3>
            <p>
                Ten years ago, I chose the Teacher Education Program with the mission and expectations of learning advanced education
                philosophy and spreading Chinese culture. Since then, I have taught Mandarin at a public High School in
                the Bay Area. Being a reflective world languages educator, I am an active listener who gathers student
                feedback and incorporates it into my student-centered curricula. My professional experience has
                demonstrated that being empathetic is required to build trust with students, having a humorous and
                well-structured presentation style engages them, and being present and available helps them pursue
                language education throughout their high school careers.
            </p>

        <section class="aboutIntro">
            <h3>Why a career change?</h3>
            <p>
                My experience teaching Chinese in the past 10 years has exposed me to many learning technologies that
                were clearly not designed to be intuitive or user-friendly. As an empathetic thinker and lifelong
                educator, I decided to learn UX and apply my skills as an educator to design better tech for the
                education community.

            <h3>Ready to contribute as a UX UI designer.</h3>
            <p>
                To achieve my dream of working as a better learning experience designer, I have received intensive
                training through the Bloc UX design program, where I had the opportunity to collaborate with senior
                designers to complete independent projects. Through professional training and real-word practices, with
                these skill sets and transferable strengths, I am ready to be a valuable team member who canâ€™t wait to
                share and try the unconstrained ideas with other creative minds, as a UX UI designer.
