                    Although online education is not a new concept, people have begun to need and use it more recently.
                    A robust and agile platform for synchronous instruction can support a smooth transition online for
                    educators and learners.

                    <p class="text">
                        As online education has become particularly salient due to the pandemic, teachers have
                        encountered multiple logistical challenges as they transition online. Throughout the discovery phase, I
                        found that online instruction has brought <span style="font-weight: 500; letter-spacing: 0.5px;">immense challenges</span> to <span style="font-weight: 500; letter-spacing: 0.5px;">prompt attendance-taking</span>, <span style="font-weight: 500; letter-spacing: 0.5px;">group work

                    Our goal is to fully consider each task and step that language teachers need to fulfill during

                    straightforward and accurate information. The <span style="font-weight: 500; letter-spacing: 0.5px;">breakout room monitor</span> allows teachers to supervise
                    group activities more efficiently, while the <span style="font-weight: 500; letter-spacing: 0.5px;">improved reminder/notification system</span> ensures smoother

                    Scrutinizing the competitors’ major user flows and features helped me decide on the optimal
                    experience for my potential users. Among the popular video conferencing companies, Zoom's software
                    usage saw a significant global increase following the introduction of quarantine measures adopted in
                    response to the pandemic. Google Meet is backed up by the powerful Google Workplace, used by 120
                    million students and educators worldwide to create, collaborate, and communicate, despite school
                    closures. Based on the 3 primary problems identified earlier, I focused on how well Zoom and Google
                    Meet help users manage attendance-taking, breakout room tasks, and reminders/notifications.

                    Combining the research findings and the solutions to tackle users’ challenges, I created
                    high-priority user stories and then converted them into user flows. Below, you will see how users would interact
                    with the product to achieve their goals.

                    With the high-priority user stories and flows in mind, I was able to sketch out the ideas on paper

                    I explained my work to a couple of colleagues after our bi-weekly department meetings on Zoom. The
                    ideas and solutions stirred up some great conversations about how to better display the breakout room
                    monitor in a more convenient way without taking too many steps or clicks. I moved forward with this valuable
                    feedback and put them into action on a more refined wireframe using Figma.

                    I developed the mid-fidelity wireframes to get ready for user testing. I took my colleagues’

                    expressed during the paper prototype discussion into consideration. They loved the breakout room
                    monitor; however, they also found it troublesome to make extra clicks to monitor the rooms.

                    I ran the usability tests with 3 potential users. Self-reported claims were used to record
                    participants’ speech and actions. For this test, I wanted to test the interaction flow, the learning
                    curve, and the clarity of the information. Through the test, I learned the following areas could be
                    improved.

                    I also asked participants’ opinions if the design could help them achieve the 3 goals: taking
                    prompt attendance, supervising breakout room activities simultaneously, and enjoying a better
                    reminder/notification system. All of them gave me positive feedback, and I felt confident to
                    convert these wireframes into hi-fi prototypes. </p>

            <p class="text1">
                I have been questioning myself throughout the project: there are so many good flows that Zoom, Google
                Meet, and other video conferencing platforms have designed. Can I borrow the good ideas, or should I
                re-design everything? I made the decision to take reducing the learning curve as the priority, learned
                from the mainstream products, and put more energy on solving the specific problems users identified.
                User testing proved I made the right choice.
            </p>
            <p class="text1">
                Also, throughout the project, I realized how important the interactions with potential users are during
                each stage of the design process to ensure the product is based on user-centered design. I collected
                valuable and crucial feedback from different testers.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                While this project mainly focused on solving language teachers’ problems, my next step will be targeting
                language learners’ concerns. I believe with new rounds of research, ideation, wireframing, prototyping,
                and testing, the new project could be realized soon.
